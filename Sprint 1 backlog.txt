Functionalities to be developed:
User story 1 and 2.

1. As a user, I want to create a task.
 - Users should be able to create new task records that will accept task name and task deadline input that will be saved to a database. 
 - All created tasks wil have a task id, date created, and task status which will be set to 'Not Started' by default.
 - The input form should not be submitted when input fields are incomplete, the task deadline date value should have a default value of the current day and should not accept any dates before the current date.
 - The insert query must use prepared statements to prevent sql injection attacks.
2. As a user, I want to view my created tasks so I can keep track of my activities
- User tasks should be displayed in a table at the home page with all corresponding details.
- The list should be dynamically updated when a new record is inserted.
